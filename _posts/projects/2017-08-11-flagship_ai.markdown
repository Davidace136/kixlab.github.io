Even though recent improvement in speech recognition and NLP accelerated development in conversational agents, keeping user needs and usability in mind and setting the right expectation and mental model is crucial in improving interaction between agents and humans. We try to apply HCI approach to conversational agents and build right interaction model for conversational agents, which is proactive, natural and flexible. For those purposes, we are mining contexts from conversations and implementing strategies for conversational flow and user-agent collaboration.
