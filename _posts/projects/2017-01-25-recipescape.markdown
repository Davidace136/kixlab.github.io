In this culture analytics research, we explore how analyzing cooking recipes in aggregate and in scale helps discovering the core values in the collective cooking culture, and answer fundamental questions like ''what makes a chocolate chip cookie a chocolate chip cookie''. Aspiring cooks, professional chefs and cooking hobbyists share their recipes online resulting in thousands of different procedural instructions towards a shared goal. However, existing approaches focus merely on analysis at the ingredient level, for example, extracting ingredient information from individual recipes. We introduce RecipeScape, a prototype interface which supports visually querying, browsing and comparing cooking recipes at scale. We also present the underlying computational pipeline of RecipeScape that scrapes recipes online, extracts their ingredient and instruction information, constructs a procedural graphical representation, and computes similarity between pairs of recipes. RecipeScape demonstrates initial insights to building a generalizable analytics framework for procedural instructions which aims to uncover collective knowledge, trends and patterns in human behavior.
