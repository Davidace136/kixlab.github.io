We explore how analyzing cooking recipes in aggregate and in scale helps discovering the core values in the collective cooking culture, and answer fundamental questions like ‘‘what makes a chocolate chip cookie a chocolate chip cookie’’.
Aspiring cooks, professional chefs, and cooking hobbyists share their recipes online resulting in thousands of different procedural instructions towards a shared goal.
We introduce RecipeScape, a prototype interface which supports visually querying, browsing and comparing cooking recipes at scale.

We also present the underlying computational pipeline of RecipeScape that scrapes recipes online, extracts their structural semantics from ingredient and instruction information, constructs a procedural graphical representation, and computes similarity between pairs of recipes.

Joint research project with [Stanford University](http://brown.stanford.edu/).
