Personality has a significant influence on individuals' behavior in co-located groups, affecting group performance, collaboration, and group dynamics. For this reason, many companies and organizations operated by co-located groups utilize personality questionnaires. While self-assessment is widely used to detect personality, it is prone to bias due to self-reporting. Hence, automatic personality assessment (APA), which infers personality by analyzing a person's behavioral data, is on the rise. However, existing APA systems do not take into account the fact that a person's behaviors displayed in a group may differ from their behaviors outside the group. Moreover, little research has studied users' perception towards APA systems: privacy issues and the effect of data collection on their natural behaviors. In order to fill this gap, we present a system that automatically detects the user's personality in a co-located group by analyzing their group-specific behavioral data both online and offline: user's online messenger and web/app usage, and offline location and movement. Further, we discuss how the complex relationship between system accuracy, privacy issues, and behavior change should be taken into account when designing APA systems.
