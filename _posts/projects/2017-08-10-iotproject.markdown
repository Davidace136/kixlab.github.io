In order for ‘smart space’, where objects in the space notice users’ intentions and provide services accordingly, to be realized, it is crucial to detect intentions of the users in the physical space. In this project, we install various sensors in the physical spaces (e.g. lab, seminar room and lounge) and based on the data gathered from the sensors, we generate data-driven personas to classify users in the space that is related to users’ intentions. (This is part of the research project, ‘Development of Autonomous IoT Collaboration Framework for Space Intelligence’, with 5 other labs.)
