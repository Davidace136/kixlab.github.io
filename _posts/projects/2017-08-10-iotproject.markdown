Informal communication is a kind of communication that is not scheduled in advance, unlike recurring meetings. Informal communication is known to increase collaboration and information sharing in the workplace. To promote informal communication with technology, previous approaches have captured and displayed the user’s availability information, like in a messenger app that shows the user’s current status. In this project, we take the position that it is crucial to not only consider the user’s immediate status but also their long-term usage patterns and even personality. To infer the user’s availability for informal communication, we analyze both online data (messenger logs) and physical data (sound sensors, beacons, etc.).

This research is sponsored by IITP (Ministry of Science and ICT) under “Development of Autonomous IoT Collaboration Framework for Space Intelligence” project.
