In the design process, persona methods are widely used to better understand user needs, and to simulate user experiences for a successful product/service design. Traditionally personas were developed with user interviews and focus groups. However, these qualitative methods are subject to designer bias, costly, and time consuming. In this project, we aim to build data driven personas by analyzing interactions at scale captured by rich sensors in the smart spaces to complement these pitfalls of qualitative persona methods.

This research is sponsored by IITP (Ministry of Science and ICT) under “Development of Autonomous IoT Collaboration Framework for Space Intelligence” project.
