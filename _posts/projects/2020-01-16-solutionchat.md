SolutionChat is an online chat system designed to support untrained moderators to manage a structured discussion. Often, we use an online chat room as a discussion channel. But a chat channel raises some challenges for discussion. First, It can be too chaotic. Second,  keeping track of latest discussion state is not easy. Third, Moderator often burnded for real-time supports. We would to address those challenges by supporting structure discussion in a chat room, discussion stage tracking, and moderator's task. we introduce SolutionChat, a system that (1) visualizes discussion stages and featured opinions and (2) recommends contextually appropriate moderator messages. Results from a controlled lab study (n=55, 12 groups) suggest that participants' perceived discussion trackability was significantly higher with SolutionChat than without. Also, moderators provided better summarization with less effort and better managerial support using system-generated messages with SolutionChat than without. With SolutionChat, we envision untrained moderators to effectively facilitate chat-based discussions of important community matters. [Website](https://solutionchat.kixlab.org)
