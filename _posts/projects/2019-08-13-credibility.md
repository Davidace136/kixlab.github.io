Misinformation, which refers to information that is misleading or false, can quickly reach millions of readers with the help of algorithms optimized for engagement and inattentive or malicious users. Although improving the predictive accuracy of ML models is a worthwhile goal, we believe engaging humans into the decision making process should be equally as important. As such, this project explores opportunities in embedding organic crowdsourcing in online discussion domain, as to enable readers in the online platforms to do useful work that benefits both themselves and the platform. 

To make this happen, we have two research questions in mind: (1) How to co-optimize the maximization of system-side information gain and user-side engagement gain? and (2) How to motivate readers to engage in more tasks? In order to answer these questions, this project aims to design a crowdsourcing system that recommends a task sequence in order to collect what system needs and interest the readers at the same time.
