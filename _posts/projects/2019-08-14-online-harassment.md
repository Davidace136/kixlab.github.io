To deal with online harassment, e.g., personal attack, stereotyping, profanity, numerous human moderators are working in every discussion site. There are also system support, e.g., automoderator, which are bot account created by human moderators or detection model used by moderators for detecting incivility, insult, profane word in a comment.  Moderators can remove the comment, block or ban the abusive user. Although this task of removing, blocking or banning a user can reduce the toxic contents from the discussion, the cost is not low. From the moderators, the task load is too high and the cognitive load is also a major issue. From the userâ€™s perspective, there are lack of transparency and feedback to the user about the moderation process.   

With these in mind, the research question we are asking is how can we design interface elements to persuade user in civil commenting and at the same time provide feedback to the user. We are trying to design interface elements to provide real-time feedback to the user, when they are commenting, using machine calculation which outputs are used by the moderators to assist the moderation task. Our expectation is that this real-time feedback will improve the trust and transparency about the moderation process and thus persuade user in civil commenting.
