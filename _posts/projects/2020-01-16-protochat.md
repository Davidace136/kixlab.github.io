Conversation design is an essential step in building a chatbot. Much like designing visual user interfaces, designing conversations benefits from prototyping and testing with users to explore and improve possible and existing conversation flows. However, it can be overwhelming to quickly iterate the conversation design as the iterative process requires not only the conversation design but also building and testing a working chatbot equipped with the conversation. We developed _ProtoChat_, a prototype system that supports an iterative design of conversation by allowing designers to (1) prototype conversations, (2) test the conversations with crowds, and (3) review and analyze the crowdsourced conversation data. Results of an exploratory study with four conversation designers show that the designers successfully iterated on their conversation design by reviewing how crowds followed the conversation, which provided insights on concrete action items to improve their conversation design.
