Collaborative Sequencing (Co-Seq) is the process of collaboratively selecting and arranging a set of items into a particular order. It commonly occurs across formal and casual domains (e.g. travel and curriculum planning). As the group must decide on the final sequence, it is desirable to reach consensus. Previous research proposes a consensus building process in which (1) a member makes a proposal, (2) the group evaluates their willingness to commit to it, (3) if they are not, they identify and discuss conflicts, and (4) resolve the conflicts. However, this process can be challenging in Co-Seq due to two main factors: (1) to evaluate a sequence (or proposal), each member must evaluate each of the numerous micro-decisions which constitutes it, and (2) members need to develop and independent understanding of alternatives for each of these micro-decisions. Our goal is to explore avenues through which system support can address these challenges.
