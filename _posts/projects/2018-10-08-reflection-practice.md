Online videos provide rich materials for people to learn conceptual knowledge, but novices often fail to transfer acquired knowledge into practice. To support learners to apply high-level concepts to the task at hand, this work aims to explore several approaches to enhance learning experience and task performance in the domain of creative tasks (e.g. writing or design). With insights drawn from reflection theories and models, we attempt to integrate reflection and practice into video learning process to enhance learning experience and work performance. Furthermore, we explore the design space of reflective prompting on video learning and the subsequent performance in creative tasks. This research will contributes findings to online video learning and creative tasks.
