Live streaming visual art such as drawing or using design soft-ware is gaining popularity. An important aspect of live streamsis the direct and real time communication between streamersand viewers. However, currently available text-based interac-tion limits the expressiveness of viewers as well as streamers,especially when they refer to specific moments or objects inthe stream. To investigate the feasibility of using snapshots ofstreamed content as a way to enhance streamer-viewer interac-tion, we introduce Snapstream, a system that allows users totake snapshots of the live stream, annotate them, and share theannotated snapshots in the chat. Streamers can also verballyreference a specific snapshot during streaming to respond toviewersâ€™ questions or comments.  Results from live deploy-ments show that participants communicate more expressivelyand clearly with increased engagement using Snapstream. Par-ticipants used snapshots to reference part of the artwork, givesuggestions on it, make fun images or memes, and log interme-diate milestones. Our findings suggest that visual interactionenables richer experiences in live streaming.
