Events keep happening everyday, with convoluted relations between them. Understanding their contents, contexts, and causalities is a difficult problem, with limited human cognitive capability. We aid people in understanding complex events with Yggdrasil, a knowledge base that contains extensive and reusable information on events. We utilized a human computation workflow that collects factual information and interpretation on events and restricts divergence between participants in generating Yggdrasil. We also present usage cases of Yggdrasil, which promote human understanding in intricate events with visualization and explanation.
