Dialog videos contain rich contextual, emotional, and intentional cues of the characters and their surroundings. In this project, we aim to build a crowdsourcing platform that collects these information from a large dialog video dataset. The collection and aggregation process can be challenging because the temporal dimension of the dataset has to be considered, and the labels are multi-dimensional and can be highly subjective. We combat these challenges by exploring crowdsourcing techniques to design workflows and answer aggregation methods that efficiently collects multi-dimensional labels and overcome the subjective nature of the collected annotations.
