MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses) aim to provide a high-quality learning experience to unlimited learners around the world at scale. As lots of learners take courses in MOOC platforms, their learning behaviors are captured in log data that could provide rich insights into how learners collectively learn. Analyzing these logs can benefit (1) learners by providing results from analysis they could self-reflect on, and (2) instructors by enabling them to understand learners and fix the problems in the current instructional material. Despite the benefits of analyzing learners’ behaviors, K-MOOC---a Korean MOOC platform---hasn’t seen much in-depth analysis yet. In this project, we will be analyzing logs from the K-MOOC platform to understand the patterns of lecture video watching pattern and to provide a guideline for an effective lecture design.
