KIXLAB has received a "Star Lab" grant from the Korean government. The grant will support our research on "object-oriented video interaction" for the next 8 years. What if we can author and watch videos with objects, relationships, and contexts than with pixels and frames? We plan to design and build next-generation interactive technologies for video authoring, watching, and analytics.
