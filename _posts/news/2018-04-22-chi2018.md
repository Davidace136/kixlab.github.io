<h2>Full Papers</h2>

<strong>Understanding the Effect of In-Video Prompting on Learners and Instructors</strong><br/>
Hyungyu Shin, Eun Young Ko, Joseph Jay Williams, Juho Kim.<br/>
<em>Tuesday 9am @ 517D: Learning and Training</em><br/>
"With in-video prompting, learners answer reflective questions
while watching videos. What do learners and instructors think about it? How can we design a meaningful learning experience for learners while giving valuable feedback to instructors?"

<strong>Enhancing Online Problems Through Instructor-Centered Tools for Randomized Experiments</strong><br/>
Joseph Jay Williams, Anna Rafferty, Dustin Tingley, Andrew Ang, Walter Lasecki, Juho Kim<br/>
<em>Tuesday 11am @ 518C: Automated and Crowd Supports for Learning</em><br/>
"Most online instructors lack the expertise and tools to design and run experiments. DynamicProblem helps online instructors to author randomized experiments on explanations, hints, feedback messages, etc. with a simple UI & interpretable machine learning."

<strong>Collaborative Dynamic Queries: Supporting Distributed Small Group Decision-making</strong><br/>
Sungsoo (Ray) Hong, Minhyang (Mia) Suh, Nathalie Henry Riche, Jooyoung Lee, Juho Kim, Mark Zachry<br/>
<em>Tuesday 2pm @ 516C: Distributed Work</em><br/>
"In small group decision making, what if everyone's preferences on decision criteria are easily collected, shared, and filtered? Meet Collaborative Dynamic Queries (CDQ), a UI componenet that improves communication effectiveness & efficiency."

<strong>BebeCode: Collaborative Child Development Tracking System</strong><br/>
Seokwoo Song, Juho Kim, Bumsoo Kang, Wonjeong Park, John Kim<br/>
<em>Wednesday 9am @ 518AB: Children, Well-being, and Play</em><br/>
"Child development tracking often relies on a single parent's responses. BebeCode is a mobile app for parents and caregivers to collaboratively gather responses, discuss, & resolve conflicts."

<strong>ConceptScape: Collaborative Concept Mapping for Video Learning</strong><br/>
Ching Liu, Juho Kim, Hao-Chuan Wang. <strong>Honourable Mention Award</strong>.<br/>
<em>Wednesday 2pm @ 517D: Learning 2</em><br/>
"What if a concept map was shown alongside an online learning video to support navigation and comprehension? ConceptScape is a concept-based video player that crowdsources generation of concept maps with expert-level quality."

<strong>RecipeScape: An Interactive Tool for Analyzing Cooking Instructions at Scale</strong><br/>
Minsuk Chang, Leonore Guillain, Hyeungshik Jung, Vivian Hare, Juho Kim, Maneesh Agrawala.<br/>
<em>Thursday 9am @ 516E: Crowdsourcing, Data Mining, Dealing with Information</em><br/>
"What can we learn from analyzing hundreds of chocolate chip cookie recipes, which are diverse & naturally crowdsourced approaches toward a shared goal? Average or exotic recipe? Fundamentally different ways of making chocolate chip cookies?"

<strong>To Distort or Not to Distort: Distance Cartograms in the Wild</strong><br/>
Sungsoo (Ray) Hong, Minjoon Yoo, Bonnie Chinh, Amy Han, Sarah Battersby, Juho Kim<br/>
<em>Thursday 2pm @ 518C: Visualization of Space and Shape</em><br/>
"What if your map is rendered based on travel time rather than distance? How does this 'distorted map' affect users' location decision making experience when used in the wild?"



<h2>Late-Breaking-Work</h2>

<strong>Exprgram: A Language Learning Interface for Mastering Pragmatic Competence</strong><br/>
Kyungje Jo, John Joon Young Chung, Juho Kim.<br/>
<em>LBW057. Tuesday 10:20-11:00 & 15:20-16:00 @ 220BC Exhibit Hall</em><br/>

<strong>Micro-NGO: Tackling Wicked Social Problems with Problem Solving and Action Planning Support in Chat</strong><br/>
Sung-chul Lee, Jihee Kim, Juho Kim.<br/>
