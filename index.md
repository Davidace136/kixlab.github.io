The KAIST Interaction Lab (KIXLAB) is a human-computer interaction research group in the School of Computing at KAIST.
We build interactive systems that support interaction at scale.
We often take an interdisciplinary approach to our research,
by connecting computer science with learning science and social science,
and aim to deploy our systems to real users.<br>
